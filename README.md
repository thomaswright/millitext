# Millitext

Currently at https://thomaswright.github.io/millitext.

This is a generator for the 1px wide font [millitext](https://www.msarnoff.org/millitext/) by Matt Sarnoff and inspired by his [older project](https://github.com/74hc595/millitext). The font exploits the fact that pixels are really three sub-pixels. If you get a microscope, a camera with a macro lens, or an old monitor, you should be able to see the result really is letters! You might have to zoom out to make the pixels true pixels on modern high-resolution displays.

## Development

Run ReScript in dev mode:

```sh
npm run res:dev
```

In another tab, run the Vite dev server:

```sh
npm run dev
